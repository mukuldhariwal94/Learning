1st normalization

- each cell is single valued 
- rows are uniquely identified
- entries in a column are of the same type


2nd Normation form

all attributes ( NON-key ) are dependent on the key of the table

make sure that any columns unrelated to the key have to be sperated out 

A junction table matches two tables


Compound key = is a bunch of keys 


3rd NF 


all fields ( columns ) can be determined only by the key in the table and no other column

only key the key can help us determine the value of the table ( this reduces the data redundancy )

this about. 
Think about if the data is to be changed do we have to change all values in the table. 

4th normal form 
No multivalued - dependencies.

try to see if all values depenend

don't allow multiple values in a column


for example if someone has more than one shipping address


Summary 
why normalize 
1) avoid redundancy 
2) to attain integrity 
3) to put data into correct tables 
4) to avoid CUD anamolies
